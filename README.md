#Create HTML Pixel-Art by image

####Every single pixel is just a square div with diffrent background nothing special :D
I know that is has no use but its great to show it to your friends and make some fun out of it :)


##Usage:
* import image you want to convert to pixel art and rename it to image.[extension]
* open main.py and insert your configuration:
* * resolution of the pixel-art
* * pixel size
* your output will be in index.html file ready to open in your browser

#### I imported sample image with output so you can look it up :P
